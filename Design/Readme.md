- Step 3: Interface Definition: Define what APIs are expected from the system. (5-10 min) ✅

- Step 4: High-level design: Draw a block diagram with 5-6 boxes representing core components of your system.( 10-15 min) ✅

- Step 5: Detailed component design: Discuss more about 2-3 components; interviewers feedback should always guide you towards which parts of the system he wants you to explain further. (10-15min) ✅

- Step 6: Define data model: This will clarify how data will flow among different components of the system and later will also guide you towards data partitioning and databse schema. (10-15 min) ✅
